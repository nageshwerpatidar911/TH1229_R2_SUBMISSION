## Problem & Solution  

### The Problem  
Large-scale gatherings like the Simhastha present challenges such as:  
- **Information gaps:** Pilgrims often rely on scattered or outdated sources for schedules, temple timings, or circulars.  
- **Overcrowding:** Lack of real-time data on crowd density can lead to congestion and safety risks.  
- **Lost belongings & missing persons:** A frequent, stressful issue in massive gatherings.  
- **No unified digital hub:** Currently, attendees lack a centralized platform combining spiritual, cultural, and logistical support.  

### The Solution  
The portal addresses these pain points through an integrated digital ecosystem:  
- **Centralized Hub:** All official updates, temple details, and tourism information consolidated in one place.  
- **Live Crowd Density Map:** Real-time insights into crowd levels at ghats, temples, and mela sites to help visitors plan safely.  
- **Digital Lost & Found:** Easy reporting and retrieval process to reunite people and belongings.  
- **Live Darshan:** Virtual access to rituals for the elderly, differently-abled, or those avoiding heavy crowds.  
- **Tourism Expansion:** Extending beyond Ujjain to highlight Madhya Pradesh’s historic monuments and pilgrimage circuits.  

This not only enhances safety and convenience but also transforms the **pilgrimage into a connected, accessible, and inclusive experience**.
